                        This app works best on the latest version of Google Chrome, although recent versions of Opera,
                        FireFox and IE <em>should</em> work as well.

                    div.
                        Silly answer is: refresh the page (usually by pressing F5). This will solve the vast
                        majority of problems.

                            Click the "Create Map" option on the very top left of the screen, enter the name of the new
                            map, press "Enter" and start adding shapes by dragging them from the "Objects" list on the
                            map controls bar. The map will be sync'd to the remote database automatically as you edit.
                        div.

                    div.
                        On complex maps (having dozens or hundreds of shapes and links) it might get slow to interact
                        with the map, indeed. If you're experiencing this, please try
                        <a href="javascript:System.App.Data.userSettings.slowDevice(true);" title="Click to enable the slow device mode">enabling the slowDevice option</a>.
                        This will effectively disable most UI effects and slow the data refresh ratio to cope with
                        limited processing power.

                    div.
                        The types of objects you have on your infrastructure are represented by "Entity Definitions".
                        Each of these definitions have one or more "Entity Objects". Making a direct comparison to
                        databases, entity definitions are the tables and entity objects are the records.
                li

                            Click on "Entities" on the top of the screen and create a new Entity Definition there.
                            You must specify the "Source URL" (local or remote) to a JSON file containing a list with
                            all objects for that particular definition, and set the "Refresh" interval in seconds.
                    else
                        div.
                            You don't have the necessary permissions to manage Entity Definitions and Objects, so
                            please contact the administrator if you want to add new Entities.
                li
                    label Can I import Entities from XML, CSV or text files?
                    div.
                        No, at the moment #{title} supports only JSON files. Please note that the JSON file must contain
                        the array of entity objects on root level, enclosed with square brackets [].
                li
                    label I can't see a particular entity object listed on the "Objects" list. Why?

                            Click on "Entities" on the top of the screen, select the desired entity definition and make
                            sure that the "Source URL" property for that particular entity is properly set. If the URL
                            is correct, it might be that the "Refresh" interval is too long so please set it to a lower
                            value.
                    else
                        div.
                            You don't have the necessary permissions to manage Entity Definitions and Objects, so
                            please wait for a few minutes - it might be that the entity objects were not sync'd yet
                            but that should happen automatically in a few minutes.

                    div.
                        We guess you might have a few monitoring tools checking the health and state of your systems.
                        Just like "Entities", you can import these monitoring data into #{title} by creating
                        "Audit Data" records, specifying a local or remote "Source URL" for each and a refresh interval.
                li
                    label How to bind Audit Data values to shapes and links on a map?
                    div.
                        When edtiting label values, a list with all available Audit Data records (along with Variables)
                        will be displayed right below the input field. Click on the desired Audit Data record to update
                        the list with its properties and values and keep clicking / navigating till you reach the
                        specific data you want. A bound Audit Data value should look like:
                    div.
                        <em>#audit.Audit_Data_ID.property1.subproperty[index]</em>
                li
                    label How often are Audit Data values refreshed?
                    div.
                        The refresh interval is set per Audit Data. So one could be refreshed every 5 minutes while
                        another gets updated every 10 seconds. The minimum accepted value is 2 seconds.

            ul.qa
                li
                    label What are Audit Events?
                    div.
                        Audit Events are a combination of rules and actions to notify users about the state of the
                        monitored systems. You can define multiple rules, and if any of these rules are valid (true),
                        it will trigger the specified actions on all the shapes which have this particular
                        alert attached.
                li
                    label How do I create Audit Events?
                    div.
                        Click the "Audit Events" button on the top of the page, and the Audit Events manager will open.
                        On the left part of the panel you can see a list of registered alerts and also create new
                        alerts. On the right side you can see the list of rules and actions for the currently
                        selected alert.
                li
                    label How can I set the source or target of a rule to a specific shape label?
                    div.
                        To set the source or target to a label on the shape, use the
                        <strong><span class="prefix-auditeventcontext"></span></strong> prefix and the label number.
                        The label numbers are: left 1, top 2, right 3, bottom 4, center 5. So to compare the left label
                        with the right label, you would use
                        <em><span class="prefix-auditeventcontext"></span>1</em> as source and
                        <em><span class="prefix-auditeventcontext"></span>3</em> as target.

                    label What are Variables?
                    div.
                        Custom variables are javascript code blocks that gets parsed and interpreted on demand.
                        They're mainly used to aggregate and process
                        values from Audit Data itens, which can then be shown on map labels or used in Audit Events.
                        Variables are prefixed
                        by <strong><span class="prefix-variables"></span></strong>.
                li
                    label Can I pass arguments when using Variables?
                    div.
                        Yes, you can pass arguments inside parentheses. For example:
                        <em><span class="prefix-variables"></span>CalculateCPU(1)</em>
                        or <em><span class="prefix-variables"></span>GetRequestsPerSec(1,3,6,7)</em>.

                    div.
                        A few. Pressing <em>Ctrl+S</em> will save the current map. <em>Ctrl+E</em> will enable editing
                        the map (if you have permissions).
                        <em>Ctrl+T</em> will toggle the fullscreen mode. Pressing <em>Esc</em> will usually cancel any
                        pending actions and close overlays.
                        Fore more details, open the Settings tab.
