SYSTEM APP CHANGE LOG
+ = new features
* = changes and bug fixing
- = removed features

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  0.6.4
+ New homepage with a live demo now available! Check http://systemapp.io.
* Fixed bugs when editing Audit Events (updated values were not being saved).
* Fixed bugs on entity objects title implementation.

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  0.6.3, 2013.05.21
* Fixed bugs when removing shapes from a map.
* Fixed bug when trying to load an invalid map or deleted map, the "loading"
  icon would freeze and never go away.
* Forms fields marked with a "silent" class won't show the "Saved!" text when
  field value is saved. For example on the left list on the Entities Manager.

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  0.6.2, 2013.05.16
* Refactored the shape selection code. Selecting and editing multiple shapes
  works but it's still disabled on this version, and will be fully enabled
  on the next release next week.
* Guest users won't see elements that they shouldn't have access on the UI,
  for example the "Create map" on the top menu is now hidden.
* Updated client javascript libraries.
* Lots of small optimizations and bug fixes across the app.

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  0.6.1, 2013.05.08
+ Maps now have an owner (defined by the "createdByUserId" property).
+ New zoom implementation, zooming in and out is now way faster than before.
+ Shapes can now have icon's expanding to their full size.
+ Revamped UI implementation for debugging notice and general alerts, especially
  a quickly shown "Saved" message next to saved input fields.
* Refactored the event rule values to use label names instead of index. So when
  targeting the left label for example, it's now "@left" instead of "@1".
* Fixed: missing .active class when Variables Manager is open.
* Fixed: when removing data from any overlay (Audit Data, or Variables for example)
  if the removed model was bound to the view, it wouldn't clear the form fields and
  thus making it possible to save the model even if it was removed.
* Fixed: incorrect checks for permissions on the client side. The "loggedUser"
  object wasn't being set, and this all client permission checks were invalid.

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  0.6.0, 2013.05.06
+ Demo environment moved from Rackspace East to AWS Europe.
  Now accessible via http://systemapp.io/demo
+ New "Variable Manager" view to add, edit and delete user created variables.
+ Added vertical overflow (scrollbars) if needed on overlay lists.
+ Scrollbars are now styled and feels more integrated on Webkit browsers.
+ User authentication is now available. The default admin user has
  username "admin", password "system".
* When editing shape labels, the z-index of the label editor view will be set
  and incremented when there's more than 1 label editor visible.
* The "lock" and "auto refresh" toggles were moved to the right corner of the top menu.
* Fixed tutorial init bugs (because of namespace updates from System.App to SystemApp).
* Fixed bug with "toggleFullscreen" called on the MpView instead of MapControlsView.
* Fixed bug with the search field not editable on the "Objects" tab on the map controls.
* Fixed Logentries integration bugs (binding to wrong Winston object).
* Fixed incorrect checks for permissions when creating and editing maps.
* Created folder for routers: appRouter.coffee (main) and adminRouter.coffee (for admin area).
* IMPORTANT! Debug is now true by default while the app is still in beta. We'll set the default
  to false again once it reaches a state considered stable enough for production environments.
- Removed the "settings.base.coffee" file on the client side. Settings will be refactored soon
  having a single settings file for both server and client settings.
- Removed the user editable modifier keys on the Settings View till we get the validations in
  place on the UI. These will be enabled again on a future release.

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  0.5.6, 2013.04.26
+ New official website at http://systemapp.io
+ Now you can pass options to the app via querystring:
  ?debug=1 will activate debug mode
  ?fullscreen=1 will set map to fullscreen automatically
* Fixed syncing problems when adding/removing/editing Entity Definitions.
  Most important changes were made on the manager.coffee (server side) and
  entitiesTabView.coffee (client side).
* Improved console logging with timestamps.
- External resources will be saved to the MongoDB always now, so we removed
  the "Web.saveDataEveryRefresh" setting.
- The docs available at: http://coffeedoc.info/github/zalando/system/master/
  have incorrect links, so please do not use thvim settings.ese in the mean time. The
  official docs are available under the /docs directory of the app.

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  0.5.5, 2013.04.24
+ The "Settings" tab is now working. Some extra settings and features
  will be added there in the future.
* Updated client libraries (in special jQuery 2.0.0).
* Improved AlertView, avoids showing similar alerts in short periods of time.
* Major refactoring, renamed System.App namespace to SystemApp on the client
  models and views and changed the document ready init code.
* Refactored the way the "settings.coffee" work on the server. Now it expects
  a settings.json file with the user-specific settings.
* Fixed bug: map controls for shapes and links would be visible and editable
  even when no shape or link was selected.

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  0.5.3, 2013.04.19
+ Major UI overhaul. Interface is now much cleaner. All unnecessary UI elements
  like borders, shadows and transparencies were thrown away.

* Updated node modules.
* Fixed UI bugs on the header and map controls.

- Because of the soon-to-be-available user authentication the godMode setting
  was permanently removed from the app.
