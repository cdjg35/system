SYSTEM APP CHANGE LOG
+ = new features
* = changes and bug fixing
- = removed features

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  0.5.6, 2013.04.26
+ New official website at http://systemapp.io
+ Now you can pass options to the app via querystring:
  ?debug=1 will activate debug mode
  ?fullscreen=1 will set map to fullscreen automatically
* Fixed syncing problems when adding/removing/editing Entity Definitions.
  Most important changes were made on the manager.coffee (server side) and
  entitiesTabView.coffee (client side).
* Improved console logging with timestamps.
- External resources will be saved to the MongoDB always now, so we removed
  the "Web.saveDataEveryRefresh" setting.
- The docs available at: http://coffeedoc.info/github/zalando/system/master/
  have incorrect links, so please do not use these in the mean time. The
  official docs are available under the /docs directory of the app.

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  0.5.5, 2013.04.24
+ The "Settings" tab is now working. Some extra settings and features
  will be added there in the future.
* Updated client libraries (in special jQuery 2.0.0).
* Improved AlertView, avoids showing similar alerts in short periods of time.
* Major refactoring, renamed System.App namespace to SystemApp on the client
  models and views and changed the document ready init code.
* Refactored the way the settings.coffee work on the server. Now it expects
  a settings.json file with the user-specific settings.
* Fixed bug: map controls for shapes and links would be visible and editable
  even when no shape or link was selected.

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  0.5.3, 2013.04.19
+ Major UI overhaul. Interface is now much cleaner. All unnecessary UI elements
  like borders, shadows and transparencies were thrown away.
+ Added the required modules for authorization, user and roles.
  The basic HTTP authentication will be available from version 0.6.0.
* Updated node modules.
* Fixed UI bugs on the header and map controls.
- Got rid of unnecessary styles (mainly the .styled class).
- Because of the soon-to-be-available user authentication the godMode setting
  was permanently removed from the app.
